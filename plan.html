<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the CossiePlay website is to get 30% more profits and company awareness with 3 months by attracting more people come to the parties and get costumes made. At the same time, to appeal to a younger audience which are high school kids and young adults.</p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p> As well as conducting other promotional activities and keep profits, survey online and in person are our way to evaluate whether the increase in sales are attributed to the website. Consumers will be asked to answer question “How do you know our company?” from several options. After 3 months, we count the increase number of costumes orders and profits to the previous months.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>The website target at high school kids and young adults who emphasize creativity and wish to have custom-made costumes to show their distinct personality. In other words, they want their dressing is different from anyone else. They wear costumes to express their personal style rather than just follow the trend. 
</p>

<p>In addition to this, they are from middle class and are sensitivity to price and quality. They will buy second-hand costumes. And they like both online shopping and physical stores.</p>

<p>The site will be designed in a creative way by using colourful images and style to cater for the young audience.</p>
